# live-text-demo
This is a demo project of Live Text Demo prior to iOS 15. It can detect and recognize text from camera in real-time with the `Vision` Framework. 
In this demo, we do not have the smart content type detection of Live Text in iOS 15. Instead, a sight is provided to let users aim at the text manually and naturally for detection.
